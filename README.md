## Git

Git is a version control system that that tracks and manages changes to files over time. It allows you to:

- Track changes over multiple files
- Compare versions of a project
- Revert to a previous version
- Collaborate and share changes
- Combine changes

The repository or repo is a workspace that tracks and manages the files in a folder. You must create a repo for each project.

Refer to the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/ "Git documentation") for full details about using Git.
